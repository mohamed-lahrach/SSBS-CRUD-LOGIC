"""
Global project test suite placeholder.

Guidance for future tests in this module:
- Keep this file for cross-app integration and end-to-end workflow tests only.
- Do not duplicate app-level unit/API coverage that belongs to app-local tests.
- Prefer scenario-style tests that traverse multiple apps in one workflow.
- Validate project-wide concerns (routing, exception handling, global settings).
